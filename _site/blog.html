    <p>Recently, I start to reorganize my personal website with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I knew this tool from the first day I tried GitHub Pages (perhaps in 2018). At that time, I did not read through the documentation and thought this is only a “theme” tool, which modifies my website to a look I don’t like. So I did not use it, but started from scratch to build an HTML + CSS static site. It was a happy learning process. I started to learn using the <a href="freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp online app</a>, and got good understanding of the web development basics. With some practice, I eventually was able to tune my website front page to the way I wanted.</p>
