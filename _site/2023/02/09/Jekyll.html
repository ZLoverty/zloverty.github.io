  <p>Recently, I start to reorganize my personal website with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I knew this tool from the first day I tried GitHub Pages (perhaps in 2018). At that time, I did not read through the documentation and thought this is only a “theme” tool, which modifies my website to a look I don’t like. So I did not use it, but started from scratch to build an HTML + CSS static site. It was a happy learning process. I started to learn using the <a href="freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp online app</a>, and got good understanding of the web development basics. With some practice, I eventually was able to tune my website front page to the way I wanted.</p>

<p>After making the front page successfully, I got more ambitious: I want the website to be more informative about who I am and what I do. In particular, I wanted to make my website a portal for all my research activities, where my ideas, data, thoughts and nice visuals were organized together. Although this sounds like a good idea, when I really went about to do it, it soon got very painful because the number of .html files grew very quickly. I was very frustrated when I updated the “Last edited: xxx” string in the footer of my site, because every time I needed to modify all the .html files.</p>

<p>Because of that, I stopped working on the website for a while. And only recently, when I use shpinx to build code documentations, I start to think that there should be a tool like sphinx, which translate simple markup language to html. Interestingly, this tool is Jekyll, which I overlooked (or underestimated) 5 years ago! After reading through the documentations, I am very sure that this is the tool I am looking for. I can customize the templates freely, write normal content in Markdown, and use .yml text file to serve as database. At the moment of writing, I am still working on the framework of the website (creating templates and tuning css). But I can already see that in the near future, I can maintain the website just by adding a simple entry in the data file.</p>

<p>Read the documents, at least to know what the tool is designed for. This is the lesson I learn from this experience.</p>
