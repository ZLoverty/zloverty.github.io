  abstract   = {Using computational modeling, we suggest and demonstrate a novel class of building blocks for nanoparticle self-assembly, that is, shape-shifting patchy nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are designed by harnessing dynamic covalent bonds between nanoparticles and patches decorated on them. The breaking and reforming of these bonds in response to their environment allow the patches to undergo a structural rearrangement that shifts the location or number of patches. Our simulations for the assembled superstructures and kinetic pathway of two types of these building blocks demonstrate that shape-shifting patchy nanoparticles delicately meet two emerging design concepts of next generation materials: rational self-assembly and responsive matter. In this context, these nanoparticles may enable new generations of materials with reconfigurable property as well as controllable topologies in a dynamical manner.},

  abstract = {The precise organization of nano-objects into welldefined patterns at interfaces is an outstanding challenge in the field of nanocomposites toward technologically important materials and devices. Herein, by means of computer simulations we show novel mechanomutable nanocomposites designed by binary mixtures of tethered Janus nanoparticles at the interface of a binary fluid mixture under mechanical pressure. Our simulations demonstrate that the nanoparticle organization in the systems undergo reversible transition between random state and long-ranged intercalation state, controlled by various structural parameters of the tethered chains and the applied pressure. The dynamical mechanism during the transition is explored through examining the diffusion trajectories of the nanoparticles confined at the interfaces. We provide a theoretical analysis of the lateral pressure induced by the tethered chains, which is fully supported by simulation data and reveals that the compressioninduced transition is fundamentally attributed to the entropic effect from the tethered chains. Our study leads to a class of interface-reactive nanomaterials in which the transfer and recovery of interfacial nanopatterning presents precise and tunable mechanical responses.},

  abstract = {As a paradigmatic model of active fluids, bacterial suspensions show intriguing rheological responses drastically different from their counterpart colloidal suspensions. Although the flow of bulk bacterial suspensions has been extensively studied, the rheology of bacterial suspensions under confinement has not been experimentally explored. Here, using a microfluidic viscometer, we systematically measure the rheology of dilute Escherichia coli suspensions under different degrees of confinement. Our study reveals a strong confinement effect: the viscosity of bacterial suspensions decreases substantially when the confinement scale is comparable or smaller than the run length of bacteria. Moreover, we also investigate the microscopic dynamics of bacterial suspensions including velocity profiles, bacterial density distributions, and single bacterial dynamics in shear flows. These measurements allow us to construct a simple heuristic model based on the boundary layer of upstream swimming bacteria near confining walls, which qualitatively explains our experimental observations. Our study sheds light on the influence of the boundary layer of collective bacterial motions on the flow of confined bacterial suspensions. Our results provide a benchmark for testing different rheological models of active fluids and are useful for understanding the transport of microorganisms in confined geometries.},

  abstract  = {Giant number fluctuations are often considered as a hallmark of the emergent nonequilibrium dynamics of active fluids. However, these anomalous density fluctuations have only been reported experimentally in two-dimensional dry active systems heretofore. Here, we investigate density fluctuations of bulk Escherichia coli suspensions, a paradigm of three-dimensional (3D) wet active fluids. Our experiments demonstrate the existence and quantify the scaling relation of giant number fluctuations in 3D bacterial suspensions. Surprisingly, the anomalous scaling persists at small scales in low-concentration suspensions well before the transition to active turbulence, reflecting the long-range nature of hydrodynamic interactions of 3D wet active fluids. To illustrate the origin of the density fluctuations, we measure the energy spectra of suspension flows and explore the density\textendash energy coupling in both the steady and transient states of active turbulence. A scale-invariant density-independent correlation between density fluctuations and energy spectra is uncovered across a wide range of length scales. In addition, our experiments show that the energy spectra of bacterial turbulence exhibit the scaling of 3D active nematic fluids, challenging the common view of dense bacterial suspensions as active polar fluids.},

  abstract  = {Drying of bacterial suspensions is frequently encountered in a plethora of natural and engineering processes. However, the evaporation-driven mechanical instabilities of dense consolidating bacterial suspensions have not been explored heretofore. Here, we report the formation of two different crack patterns of drying suspensions of Escherichia coli (E. coli) with distinct motile behaviors. Circular cracks are observed for wild-type E. coli with active swimming, whereas spiral-like cracks form for immotile bacteria. Using the elastic fracture mechanics and the poroelastic theory, we show that the formation of the circular cracks is determined by the tensile nature of the radial drying stress once the cracks are initiated by the local order structure of bacteria due to their collective swimming. Our study demonstrates the link between the microscopic swimming behaviors of individual bacteria and the mechanical instabilities and macroscopic pattern formation of drying bacterial films. The results shed light on the dynamics of active matter in a drying process and provide useful information for understanding various biological processes associated with drying bacterial suspensions.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis Particle-laden fluid interfaces are the central component of many natural and engineering systems. Understanding the mechanical properties and improving the stability of such interfaces are of great practical importance. Janus particles, a special class of heterogeneous colloids, might be used as an effective surface-active agent to control the assembly and interfacial rheology of particle-laden fluid interfaces. Experiments Using a custom-built interfacial stress rheometer, we explore the effect of Janus particle additives on the interfacial rheology and microscopic structure of particle-laden fluid interfaces. Findings We find that the addition of a small amount of platinum-polystyrene (Pt-PS) Janus particles within a monolayer of PS colloids (1:40 number ratio) can lead to more than an order-of-magnitude increase in surface moduli with enhanced elasticity, which improves the stability of the interface. This drastic change in interfacial rheology is associated with the formation of local particle clusters surrounding each Janus particle. We further explain the origin of local particle clusters by considering the interparticle interactions at the interface. Our experiments reveal the effect of local particle structures on the macroscopic rheological behaviors of particle monolayers and demonstrate a new way to tune the microstructure and mechanical properties of particle-laden fluid interfaces.},
