I'm Zhengyang Liu. I'm currently doing postdoctoral research at Cornell University. I got my PhD from the Department of Chemical Engineering and Material Sciences at the University of Minnesota in 2021. My thesis is *Novel Properties and Emergent Collective Behavior of Active Fluids*. I did experiments with bacteria, algae and protein filaments, and published [some papers](cv.html). I like coding and solving problems, [work-related](https://github.com/ZLoverty/Python) or [not](https://github.com/ZLoverty/Period-visualizer), with code. I like to [extract information from images](particle_tracking.html), which I learned later that should be termed *computer vision*. I believe in open source, and I am a big fan of [GitHub](https://github.com/ZLoverty), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I feel bad when people don't put spaces around `=`. I like cooking, especially making dough.
