title: Giant number fluctuations

### Overview

Giant number fluctuations (GNF) is one of the key differences between active systems and equilibrium systems, characterized by the number fluctuations scaling with system size. I experimentally investigate the number fluctuations in 3D bacterial suspensions, and its correlation with the flow field. We find an interesting correspondence between number fluctuations and energy spectra, which is scale-invariant and concentration-independent.
