title: Drying crack of bacterial droplets
---

Particulate suspensions form cracks when desicated. This is a very ubiquitous phenomenon, with examples ranging from mud cracks in a dried river bed to a dried blood droplet. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is usually the same: the top layer of the drying suspension lose suspending liquid and tend to contract, while the bottom material stays the same size. However, the resulting crack patterns can be very different for different materials. Understanding crack patterns has potential applications, for example in blood diagnostics. We find an interesting and aesthetically pleasing crack pattern formed by drying *E. coli* suspensions.
