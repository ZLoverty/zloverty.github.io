### Overview

This is my first research project in my PhD program at Minnesota, studying the confinement effect on the rheology of bacterial suspensions. Back then, I did not have the habit of writing notes and blogs for specific problems or findings, so there is not many records of how the project evolved over time. However, there are slides and posters I made back then on this project, which hopefully provide a good overview.
