### Overview

Bacteria are microswimmers commonly found in complex environments, such as substrate surface, porous media and external flows. How they adapt to these environments is not only crucial to their suvival, but also important for the biological processes they are involved in, such as biofilm formation and infection. Due to the ecological and medical relevance of bacterial motility in complex environments, it has been investigated in more detail, thanks to the development of fast video microscopy. Here, we study the motility of the model microswimmer *E. coli* near glass surface, in the presence of a layer of oil droplets (3 um and 10 um in diameter). This droplet system simulates a soft tissue surface, while permitting direct and simultaneous imaging of both bacteria and obstacles.
