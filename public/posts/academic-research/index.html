  <h1> Academic research </h1>
  <div id="post-date">2024-05-24</div>
  <p>Today I had a chat with friends about the importance of academic research.</p>
<p>We are in a revolutionizing era. Scientific advancements frequently appear in headlines. AI, robots, VR, a lot of them have already found applications in our daily life. Even rockets, as SpaceX envisions, will make space traveling as easy as taking a flight on the earth some day.</p>
<p>As a researcher myself, who also wants to contribute to the scientific world, I find my projects fall far behind the news headlines. When everybody talks about chatbots and image generations, my field of research seems not relevant and fading out.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I read this advice &ldquo;Judge your projects according to your own standard, and don’t let the shiny objects make you doubt the worth of your work!&rdquo; by Andrew Ng in his weekly <em>The Batch</em> letters. At that time, this sentence made me feel better and doubt less about the meaning of my work. But today, when I started to doubt again and try to rediscover this letter, I got a different information: you really need to have a standard when you look at your projects. If you just accept whatever random projects that are assigned to you, without thinking through the conceptual novelty and potential application, those projects are likely failure. Plus, if you don&rsquo;t consider novelty and application, that already means a lack of motivation.</p>
<p>Also not long ago, I read another quote on Twitter. It&rsquo;s a professor (I think it&rsquo;s Zhigang Suo) sharing the most helpful general questions he has been asking throughout his career: (i) what&rsquo;s new? and (ii) Who will care? This is in exactly the same spirit as having &ldquo;a standard&rdquo; to judge a research project. That is, to identify the knowledge gap.</p>
<p>I frequently use the term &ldquo;curiosity driven research&rdquo; when I have no idea why I work on some projects. And as the friend pointed out, this is indeed just a &ldquo;nice way to say I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s useless maybe&rdquo;. He thinks we in academia are far behind those in industry who are getting all these headlines. An example he uses is, why studying animal flying? We can already buy flying robot from Amazon for cheap. When challenged this way, I really need to ask the two questions.</p>
<p>I was told (by Xiang) that &ldquo;no one has studied it before&rdquo; alone is not a good motivation. Look from now, this is consistent with the two questions. &ldquo;No one studies it before&rdquo; answers only the first question. But the second question has to be also answered clearly, before real motivation can arise.</p>
<p>Despite of the useless research I&rsquo;ve been doing, and the ill motivations I had for my research projects before, I still believe academic research has its advantage, for being encouraging for people to try out risky, seemingly useless ideas. At the very least, that (academic research funding) is giving us the pay checks, so we can survive while doing useless research, in the mean time think about the issues of the current research system.</p>
<p>I believe in diversity. If people are allowed to think differently, there are more chances for breakthrough. For individuals like myself, ask the two questions before taking on a project.</p>
<p>The above are my scattered thoughts about the question whether academic research is behind or not. Some of my anxieties are also there. I don&rsquo;t know what to conclude, but questioning myself is just great.</p>
