      <description>&lt;p&gt;While searching for a job, I find it useful to outline my competencies and weaknesses, so that I can quickly compare with the qualifications of the jobs and assess my fit. The content of this post would be very much aligned with a cover letter of a job application. Hence, it could be reused in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got my batchelor&amp;rsquo;s degree from the Polymer Material and Engineering Department at Tsinghua University. In an undergraduate research training program, I took on a computational study of a nanoparticle system which is responsive to external mechanical stimuli. Despite of the short time, this training left me with great values: (i) curiosity for scientific research, (ii) solid coding skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
