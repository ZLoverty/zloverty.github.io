Here are some pictures of the apartment at 24 Boulevard Arago Paris 75013 during our stay, mainly taken in November and December 2021. The pictures show that there was a large fraction of wall surface covered by green and black mold colonies, likely caused by high humidity. We open all the windows for about 8 hours in the day, despite the cold weather in November, and use extra electricity to heat up the chamber, the mold problem persisted. We suspect that the apartment we stayed was not properly moisture proofed. Consequently, the walls of the apartment (at least the wall paper) were damaged and the apartment was humid, cold and had unpleasant smells, hence not suitable for accommodate people.

The most serious outbreak happens in a corner of the bedroom

We tried to clean it.

But not after long it came back.

This corner is not the only place that grew mold. Actually, most of the north and west walls, which expose to the exterior of the building have this issue. Below are more pictures with time stamps.

We send you this email for two reasons:
- We shouldn't be held responsible for not cleaning the mold thoroughly because it's ultimately caused by the moisture-proof deficiency of the apartment.
- we want to tell you that this apartment is not suitable to accommodate people, unless the moisture issues are resolved.
