# French Learning Notes

## I. Pronunciation

**There is an international phonetic alphabet (IPA), which provides phonetic notations for every French words (and words in other languages too) using the same standard.** It's similar to the English phonetic notations, except that it has some special ones that English does not have, e.g. /ʀ/ for letter _r_. Note that /ʀ/ is smaller than the regular R. **To learn the pronunciations of French words correctly in the beginning, I will learn each word together with their phonetic notations.** [Collins dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english) provides very good phonetic notation resources, as well as good explanations and examples. So look up words there when learning vocabulary.
