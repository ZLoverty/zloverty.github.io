While searching for a job, I find it useful to outline my competencies and weaknesses, so that I can quickly compare with the qualifications of the jobs and assess my fit. The content of this post would be very much aligned with a cover letter of a job application. Hence, it could be reused in the near future!

I got my batchelor's degree from the Polymer Material and Engineering Department at Tsinghua University. In an undergraduate research training program, I took on a computational study of a nanoparticle system which is responsive to external mechanical stimuli. Despite of the short time, this training left me with great values: (i) curiosity for scientific research, (ii) solid coding skills.

To advance in the field of research, I applied for PhD programs in the United States, and was admitted to the Chemical Engineering program at the University of Minnesota. There, I made an important transition in my research career: I joined an experimental group and discontinued computational study. Back then, my motivation was the regret that throughout my undergraduate study, apart from courses, I never worked in a real "lab", where I could manipulate real devices and materials. This led me to the field of soft / active matter, not too far away from polymer science, but with a physical bend. In my first days in the lab, I joined a project, where the experimental part was almost finished. The purpose of joining the project was "just to get my hands dirty", according to my advisor. The only missing part was the image analysis -- to extract the positions and orientations of ellipsoidal particles in each frame.
