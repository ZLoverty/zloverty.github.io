				How many things can I do a day?
				I used to think I can read two papers in the morning.
				In the mean time, I can prepare the experiment in the afternoon.
				After the experiment, I can analyze all the data with my "miraculous" code with just a click.
				I can even have fun in the evening!
				It looks like, I can have such a "fruitful" day as a researcher, without spending much time.
				However, this was just a daydream which I had from time to time in the past several years.
			</p>

			Because of these daydreams of automating my workflow, I spent time learning programming, in various languages.
			From undergrad research, to getting a PhD degree, I have learned to use Fortran, Matlab, Python.
			There were also languages I tried to learn, but ended up not using them for work, like Lisp, C++ and JAVA.
			The time I spent on them, unfortunately, may never pay off.

			At the time I write this article, I try to think about a question:
			back in the days when I don't know anything about programming, what was driving me to learn?
			I think it was the eager to learn something that people around me are not familiar with, so I can show off.
			When people walk by and see, they may say "wow it's cool".
			But this really is not a good motivation to learn. It is a force from outside and does not sustain well when I encounter hard problems.

			I seem to get lost in regreting about the time I wasted in the past.
			And I just recall that, in this article, I want to rethink about <font style="italic">focusing</font>.
