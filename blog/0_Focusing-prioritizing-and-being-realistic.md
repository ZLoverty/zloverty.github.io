# Focusing, prioritizing and being realistic

How many things can I do a day?
I used to think I can read two papers in the morning.
In the mean time, I can prepare the experiment in the afternoon.
After the experiment, I can analyze all the data with my "miraculous" code with just a click.
I can even have fun in the evening!
It looks like, I can have such a "fruitful" day as a researcher, without spending much time.
However, this was just a daydream which I had from time to time in the past several years.

Because of these daydreams of automating my workflow, I spent time learning programming, in various languages.
From undergrad research, to getting a PhD degree, I have learned to use Fortran, Matlab, Python.
There were also languages I tried to learn, but ended up not using them for work, like Lisp, C++ and JAVA.
The time I spent on them, unfortunately, may never pay off.

At the time I write this article, I try to think about a question:
back in the days when I don't know anything about programming, what was driving me to learn?
I think it was the eager to learn something that people around me are not familiar with, so I can show off.
When people walk by and see, they may say "wow it's cool".
But this really is not a good motivation to learn. It is a force from outside and does not sustain well when I encounter hard problems.

I seem to get lost in regretting about the time I wasted in the past.
And I just recall that, in this article, I want to rethink about *focusing*.
So how to focus?
I have never tried to seek advice from other people on how to focus, so what I write here may not be a comprehensive review.
Personally, I am more efficient when I do not try to do many different things at the same time.
I still remember the AI course I dropped when I was an undergraduate student.
In the first class, I was told that Python was the programming language to use for the course homework.
I had no experience in Python before the course, so I quickly started to read basic Python tutorials for a few days.
The basics were not too different from other programming languages, and I thought I grasped them.
Then in the second class, I got the first homework assignment of the course.
It was a mini "video game" written in Python, consisting of 5 or 6 .py files.
Each file had about ten functions in it.
I started to examine the code line by line, using the knowledge I learned from the tutorials.
Very soon, I felt I was overwhelmed: it was a jump from basic data types directly to coding an application.
I tried to learn how to write functions, how to import modules, how to set environment variables in Windows.
But after all these effort, I was not able to understand the majority of the source code.
Things became scary when I found that on the day I was supposed to submit the homework, I had not started working on it.
The failure to comprehend the code frustrated me a lot and I eventually dropped the course.

Recall this experience, I do not regret the time I spent on learning everything on Python because those knowledge is still benefiting me.
However, I do regret for not being able to continue the course back then.
If I could focus more on the assignment itself, instead of grinding the technical details of the source code, I should be able to make it through.
And if I did manage to complete the course, I would have learned far more than a few technical tips of Python.
My effort was not completely wasted, but it could be more worthwhile if I know how to prioritize my tasks.
At the moment when I write this article, I am still not confident enough to say I know how to prioritize things.
But I realize that I should be vigilant not to go into infinite details.
It has happened to me many times when I read a document and click a link in the document which explains certain aspects in detail.
Eventually, links after links, I forget what I was originally reading about, and tons of information overwhelmed my memory.
Knowing everything is certainly good, but is also simply impossible.

After realizing this issue, I have been thinking what I can do to help myself focus.
One thing I am trying is to write a **note** whenever I want to do something.
For example, I want to test a hypothesis in an experiment, I will start a note by describing the hypothesis, and follow up with experimental results.
Coding is usually necessary when analyzing experimental results, and is the part where I usually got distracted (because I want to automate the analysis).
The note, in this case, can keep remind me not to spend too much time on coding, but to aim at getting results.
