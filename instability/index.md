# Instability
During the course of Y-channel viscosity measurements, we systematically lower the imposed flow rate to get the rheological response of bacterial suspensions to shear rate. As we decrease the flow rate, the interface between two fluids moves up. This is expected because bacteria are more effective in decreasing the viscosity at lower shear rate. At certain point, however, the interface starts to distort as illustrated in the figure below.

This instability prevent me to get to the "superfluidic" phase in the Y-channel and it is likely to result from the spontaneous collective flow of active fluids in strong confinement. If this is the case, measuring the quantities at the transition point from stable flow to unstable flow should reveal the nature of this instability.
