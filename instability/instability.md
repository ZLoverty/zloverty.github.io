## Instability

Flows in the Y-channel show instability at low flow rate. This instability prevent me to get to the "superfluidic" phase in the Y-channel and it is likely to be caused by the spontaneous collective flow of active fluids in strong confinement. If this is the case, measuring the quantities at the transition point from stable flow to unstable flow should reveal the nature of this instability.
