      <h1> Why Mr. Zhengyang Liu exists? </h1>
      <p id='myparagraph'>
				Through almost 30 years of life, Mr. Liu found that nothing saatisfies him more than helping other people solve problems, especially coding problems.
				Apart from that, Mr. Liu enjoys video games and video game tournaments.
				Sometimes, Mr. Liu is found cooking, just because he likes good food which he cannot afford ordering in restaurants.
				Recently, he has also picked up an image editing skill, which he used to be good at in college, for making memes.
			</p>

      <h2 class='center'> Mr. Liu's opinion on coding </h2>
      <p id='myparagraph'>
				Mr. Liu was told that computer programs can do anything that human can, when he first became a graduate student.
				He believes it to some extent since computer programs are made more and more powerful over recent years, especially in the field of AI.
				However, he does not believe computers can really "think" as humans do, At least before people completely figure out the thinking process biologically.
			</p>
      <p id='myparagraph'>
				Despite the fact that Mr. Liu does not think computer can do everything, he is a coding fanatic and hopes to organize and automate all his work (and life) around his code.
				He has always been fascinated about how interactive and dynamic modern websites are.
				Due to this reason, he tries to design his own website and hope to see how hard it really is to make such a sophiscated thing.
			</p>
      <p id='myparagraph'>
				Mr. Liu does sometimes wish he could be born several decades earlier, when computer and internet are still premature.
				He wants to participate the early stage development of these life changing technologies and experience the whole period of the revolution.
				But he cannot (sad).
			</p>

      <h2 class='center'> Mr. Liu's vision on working </h2>
      <p id='myparagraph'>
				Although he never shows any passion about working, he does think working is an integral part of his life.
				Only with such an occupation will he feel his hobbies more enjoyable.
				The work he does should have some problem-solving demands, and should have nothing to do with video games or cooking.
				Keeping a balance is essential to make life more fun.
			</p>

      <h2 class='center'> Back to the question: why exists </h2>
      <p id='myparagraph'>
				What keeps him alive is his hobbies.
				Playing and eating make him happy, and working facilitates this happiness.
				Coding is always fun. Automating, organizing and sometimes designing make his life colorful and fruitful.
				Very rarely, he writes some useless documents, which barely reflects his characteristics, to describe himself to others.
				If you are interested in this sort of things, find them below.
