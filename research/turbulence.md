title: Active turbulence
---

### Overview

Active turbulence refers to the turbulent-like flows induced by a large number of self-propelling agents, such as bacteria. Although such phenomenon has been discovered for serveral decades, the process of the transition to turbulence is not well characterized. In this work, we measured the evolution of both the flow order and mean flow velocity, and identified two kinetic pathways. Which pathway a system chooses depends on the concentration of bacteria.
