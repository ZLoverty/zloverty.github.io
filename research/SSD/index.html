		<h2> Outline </h2>
		<p> This project is mainly concerned about how system size influence the transition concentration from disordered state to ordered state in a bacterial suspension.
		<h3>1. Goal: phase diagram</h3>
		<p>
			We made a order/disorder phase diagram with two axes [gap size] and [concentration] based on the data we already have.
		</p>

			<div id='figure-cap'><b>Fig.1</b> Phase diagram of bacterial ordering state. The data is based on the work from Dip (20), Yi (170) and myself (510). <font color='red'>The actual thickness will be revised after systematic measurements. </font></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Our goal is to fill more measurements at different gap sizes, namely 100, 200, 240, 280, 340, 380, 440 um, in order to get a phase boundary. <font color='red'>According to the discussion on Feb 3rd, more drastic effect may take place at small gap limit. We will therefore examine 10, 50, 120 um in addition.</font>
		</p>
		<h3>2. Thickness control </h3>
		<p>
			Although we always assume the thickness of our coverslips is 170 um, the specification from the manufacturer is 130-170 um. In the past, we didn't care much about the accurate gap thickness, so the 170 um assumption is fine. For this project since we are systematically varying the gap thickness as the key parameter, we need to measure it carefully. Moreover, to achieve large gap thickness, we glue multiple coverslips together and use the assembly as spacer. The thickness of the glue layer is also crucial to the thickness control.
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore, we measured the thickness of single-piece, two-piece, three-piece and four-piece coverslips (multiple pieces stuck together using NOA 81 UV glue)  using caliper. We found the thickness of  single-piece coverslips is 140±10 um (where 10 um is the precision of caliper). <b>For two-piece, the thickness is 480±10 um, indicating that glue thickness is negligible. These are useful record for other experiments as well. </b>
		</P>
		<p>
			In order to access gap thickness other than multiples of 140 um, I have also placed an order for another type of coverslip (~100 um thick), with which 100, 240, 340, 440 um gaps become possible.
