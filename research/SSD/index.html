		<h2> Outline </h2>
		<p> This project is mainly concerned about how system size influence the transition concentration from disordered state to ordered state in a bacterial suspension.
		<h3>1. Goal: phase diagram</h3>
		<p>
			We made a order/disorder phase diagram with two axes [gap size] and [concentration] based on the data we already have (Fig.1).
		</p>

			<div id='figure-cap'><b>Fig.1</b> Phase diagram of bacterial ordering state. The data is based on the work from Dip (20), Yi (170) and myself (510). <font color='red'>The actual thickness will be revised after systematic measurements. </font></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Our goal is to fill more measurements at different gap sizes, namely 100, 200, 240, 280, 340, 380, 440 um, in order to get a phase boundary. <font color='red'>According to the discussion on Feb 3rd, more drastic effect may take place at small gap limit. We will therefore examine 10, 50, 120 um in addition.</font>
		</p>
		<h3>2. Thickness control </h3>
		<p>
			Although we always assume the thickness of our coverslips is 170 um, the specification from the manufacturer is 130-170 um. In the past, we didn't care much about the accurate gap thickness, so the 170 um assumption is fine. For this project since we are systematically varying the gap thickness as the key parameter, we need to measure it carefully. Moreover, to achieve large gap thickness, we glue multiple coverslips together and use the assembly as spacer. The thickness of the glue layer is also crucial to the thickness control.
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore, we measured the thickness of single-piece, two-piece, three-piece and four-piece coverslips (multiple pieces stuck together using NOA 81 UV glue)  using caliper. We found the thickness of  single-piece coverslips is 140±10 um (where 10 um is the precision of caliper). <b>For two-piece, the thickness is 480±10 um, indicating that glue thickness is negligible. These are useful records for other experiments as well. </b>
		</P>
		<p>
			In order to access gap thickness other than multiples of 140 um, I have also placed an order for another type of coverslip (~100 um thick), with which 100, 240, 340, 440 um gaps become possible.
		</p>
		<h3> 3. Light intensity (swimming speed) control</h3>
		<p>
			In this project, we want to control the swimming speed of bacteria at the same level for all system size measurements. One possible way to achieve it is that we use a strong enough light intensity so that in all the measurements, so that the light-induced swimming speed is always the highest possible speed.
		</p>
		<div id='figure'>
			<img src='E://Github/zloverty.github.io/research/SSD/img/speed_light.svg' width=100%>
			<div id='figure-cap'><b>Fig.1</b> Swimming speed of E. coli as a function of light intensity measured by (a) Walter et al. (b) from Peng et al.. </font></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Measurements from Walter et al. show a clear plateau at high light intensity. Peng's measurements don't show this plateau very clearly, which creates the concern that the light we use for powering the bacteria may not be strong enough.
		</p>
		<p>
			A key limitation of our light intensity is, however, not the power of the bulb, but the sensitivity of the camera. When light is too strong, the camera is over exposed and cannot do any imaging at all. This issue can be solved by adding an neutral density (ND) filter on the light path between objective and camera. By doing this, the light received by the sample is unchanged, while the light that goes to the camera is significantly reduced. <font color='red'> A schematic will be shown later describing how to install the ND filter.</font>

	<h3> 4. Determination of collective motions <h3>
	<p>
		Eye inspection should be enough to get some preliminary results. In the future, I plan to implement a simple program based on Yi's method (calculating order parameter from PIV analysis) to describe the transition more quantitatively.
