			<h1> Evolution of giant number fluctuations with increasing swimmer velocity</h1>
				<p>Giant number fluctuation (GNF) is a key distinction of active matter compared to systems in equilibrium. Theories have predicted the deviation of number fluctuations in active matter in a quantitative way. Later on, the predictions are tested in experiment and were mostly true. Despite the success of the theories, the underlying mechanism of GNF still remains to be a hypothesis due to the difficulty of resolving individual active units and the interaction between individual active units in a crowded collection. A recent work by <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12399'>Peng et al.</a> shows that in the transition to active turbulence, flow order and flow energy grow with different time scale. GNF also grows during the course of active turbulence transition, by look at the time scale of this transition, we could gain more insight into the mechanism of GNF.</p>


			<h2> Experiment </h2>

				<p>55 n\(_0\) light-controlled E. coli suspension is sealed into a glass slide chamber and put on microscope. The light voltage is increased from 0V to 12V at \(t=5s\). The video is shot at 10 fps and is played 20 times faster of real time (data 060232020/01).</p>

				<p>I use the temporal variance -> spatial average procedure to calculate the giant number flucutation exponents at each time interval of 100 frames (10 seconds). The result is shown below:</p>

				<p> The evolving process can be seen clearly from the increase of \(\alpha\) after the light is on. However, the fluctuation magnitude at the "steady-state" is large and is not satisfactory. To explore whether the result can be presented better, I use various lengths of video to calculate \(\alpha\) over time (25, 50, 75 frames).</p>
