# My Personal Website
Here I try to use branch to mark every new version. A general workflow is:
- create a new branch with a version number
- set the goal for this version in README.md
- develop the branch
- publish the branch by [changing the publishing source in repo settings](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

## Versions
### v0
- The first stable version
### v0.1
- *use a more graphical banner for the main page (an image from experiment)*
- create a place for blogging (things I learn and think, that are not very relevant to my research projects)
- Write docs for new code in .md
