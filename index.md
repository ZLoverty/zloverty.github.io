## About me and this website

I am a graduate student at the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Minnesota. My research focuses on the collective behaviors of active particles and exotic properties of active fluids. In particular, I am interested in the interplay between them. This website will record the progress I make in my research.
