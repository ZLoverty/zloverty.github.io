## Currently

Postdoctoral associate at Gulliver, ESPCI Paris

<!-- ### Research experience

__Biological systems: bacteria and algae__
- I use microscopy, rheometry and microfluidic devices to study the transport properties, locomotion and collective motion of biological systems in controlled environments. Specifically, I have uncovered the confinement effect on the rheology of bacterial suspensions, the enhanced diffusivity in algal suspensions, and have characterized the kinetic pathways into collective motion and the flow-energy coupling in active turbulence. Currently, I'm studying the bacterial dynamics in curved spaces and the locomotion of bacteria in porous media.

__Active matter logic: microtubule-kinesin at bifurcation__
- I'm currently studying the behavior of microtubule-kinesin active matter system in microchannels with branches, as a prerequisite to achieve active matter logic. 

### Research interests

__Collective motion in complex environment__
- Some of my preliminary experiments show that bacteria exhibit oscillatory-like collective motion in spherical emulsion droplets. Similar observation in active nematic droplet suggests that topological constraints rectify the chaotic turbulence into a more regular form. Uncovering the interplay between confinement, topology and collective motion can help us understand real biological processes such as infection. 

__Active polars and nematics in experiment__
- In theoretical models, active particles can be either polars or nematics. In experiment, the categorization is not sufficient. For example, _E. coli_ bacteria are considered as polars because they always swim to the direction of their heads in dilute suspensions. However, in collective motion, they can also exhibit head-to-tail motion, and result in active turbulence that resembles their nematic counterpart. I'm interested in revealing how the polar-nematic transition happens and the new phases that could result from this transition.

__Biofilm development characterization__
- Understanding biofilm is critical to pathogen control, bioremediation of oil spill among other applications. 
A remarkable feature of biofilm is the diversity of morphology and chemical composition. 
I'm interested in how external physical parameters, such as flow and substrate properties, influence the biofilm development process.
Such knowledge can help us understand how bacteria provide structure to the extracellular matrix and benefit from extracellular reactions. -->
