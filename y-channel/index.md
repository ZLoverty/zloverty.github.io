# Y-channel
Self-propelled particles, such as bacteria, can reduce the apparent viscosity of their suspending fluid. Distinctly different from the scale-free conventional systems, an active system exhibits strong dependence on confinement geometry. By measuring viscosity of bacterial suspensions with microfluidic channel of various gap size h, we are able to quantify the dependence. This finding allows us to gain insight into the mechanism of viscosity reduction, and may provide clues for future study on active systems.
