# Y-channel
Self-propelled particles, such as bacteria, can reduce the apparent viscosity of their suspending fluid. Distinctly different from the scale-free conventional systems, an active system exhibits strong dependence on confinement geometry. By measuring viscosity of bacterial suspensions with microfluidic channel of various gap size h, we are able to quantify the dependence. This finding allows us to gain insight into the mechanism of viscosity reduction, and may provide clues for future study on the rheology of active fluids and other aspects such as ecology of bacteria in soil and microrobot engineering.

## The Y-channel viscometer
Viscosity of the same bacterial suspension is measured using Y-channel viscometers with different heights.

We have shown that this device works pretty well in measuring the viscosity of common fluids like ethanol and glycerol. No matter what the height is, the viscosity measurements are always accurate. Below are the results of some control experiments.

Is the viscosity measurements of viscometers of different heights consistent?

## Preliminary result
The figure below shows viscosity measurements with Y-channels in 4 different heights. As can be seen, in two large channels (50 um and 128 um), the viscosity of the bacteria suspension show no difference on the response to external shear rate. However, in smaller channels ( 25 um and 37 um), the change in geometry starts to modify the rheological behavior of bacterial suspensions.
